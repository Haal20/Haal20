          The work consisted of, in an educational way, meeting children in all
          types of life situations. As a student assistant, I both acted as a
          support for the child and the teacher in classrooms and on breaks. I
          worked with children from the age 6-15 years of age.

        <p>
          At EspressoHouse, you are expected to be versatile and
          stress-resistant while having good customer contact. You can
          participate in everything from checkout to food production and dishes.
          A day at the cafe is changing a lot and quickly so the ability to be
          interchangeable and be able to quickly jump in where you need is
          important, efficiency can be a key word here. The ability to see for
          yourself where one is needed is also a high priority.
