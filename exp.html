          At EspressoHouse, you are expected to be versatile and

          participate in everything from checkout to food production and dishes.
          A day at the cafe is changing a lot and quickly so the ability to be
          interchangeable and be able to quickly jump in where you need is
          important, efficiency can be a key word here. The ability to see for
          yourself where one is needed is also a high priority.
